# Matchpoint

Matchpoint is the world's simplest tennis tournament software.

I started this project in Feb 2017. It's a work in progress. Here's a list of
the high level features for the first, very simple, version. Checked features are tested and [demoable](#demos)
in the dev environment (Matchpoint isn't deployed for production yet).

- [x] User management (with [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance))
- [x] Sign in/out
- [x] Bootstrap theme
- [x] Welcome page
- [x] Home page
- [x] Tournament creation
- [x] Player registration
- [x] Generating round-robin matches 
- [ ] Entering match results
- [ ] Tournament leaderboard
